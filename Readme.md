## Introduction
The Chrome AI Autocomplete Extension is designed to enhance the user experience when typing in text fields across different websites. This extension integrates AI-powered text predictions, similar to how Cursor provides autocomplete suggestions for code. Whether you are writing a blog, filling out a form, or composing an email, this extension helps by providing inline text completions based on what you type, reducing keystrokes and improving writing efficiency. The extension is built using Chromeâ€™s Extension APIs, JavaScript, and a backend AI service to generate intelligent text predictions in real-time.

Key features of this project include:

Inline AI-powered text completions.

Seamless text suggestion acceptance with the Tab key.

Handling edge cases such as text scrolling, cursor positioning, and selection.

Cross-site functionality without interfering with existing website features.

This extension aims to minimize latency while maintaining accuracy, ensuring a smooth and intuitive user experience. It is ideal for users who frequently engage in writing-heavy tasks and need an efficient way to enhance their productivity.
